# loan_default_prediction_ML

The data analysis industry is experiencing significant growth, and machine learning models are being utilized not only in new technology sectors, but also in traditional industries. In the following contents, we elaborated the current loan security problem and emphasized the importance of involving machine learning models to help maximize the accuracy of prediction in banking and loan industry. 

To showcase the model performance, we choose customer profile data from a loan product and applied machine learning models, such as logistic regression, K-nearest neighbor, classification and regression trees, random forest, and XGboost, to predict whether the customer will be a possible defaulter. Furthermore, since there is no perfect raw data, we also applied model calibration techniques, SMOTE sampling, to select the best model for future use by checking the evaluation metrics of confusion matrix, accuracy, recall, precision, F1-score, and AUC score.  Based on the outcome of our final evaluation, we have decided to select the random forest model as our ultimate model.
